apydox is a happy, light-weight API documentation portal for your team

## Installation

To install the portal you will need to deploy and host your own instance of the software.

The documentation for deploying your very own instance of apydox can be found [here](https://docs.apydox.org).

The portal has two parts, an api and a web ui, the following are the sections on how to deploy these two parts of the application for different targets:

- [Deploying the api as serverless functions and an API gateway](https://docs.apydox.org/deployment/deploying-the-api-for-serverless)
- [Deploying the api as a docker container](https://docs.apydox.org/deployment/deploying-the-api-with-containers)
- [Deploying the web ui to S3](https://docs.apydox.org/deployment/deploying-the-portal-with-s3)
- [Deploying the web ui as a docker container](https://docs.apydox.org/deployment/deploying-the-portal-with-containers)
