This is the api for the apydox project implemented in Go.

## Installation

To install the api you will need to deploy and host your own instance of the api as either a docker container or as a set of serverless functions behind an API gateway.

The documentation for deploying your very own instance of the apydox api can be found [here](https://apydox.freshweb.io).
