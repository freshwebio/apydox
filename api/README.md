This is the api for the compendium project implemented in Go.

## Installation

To install the api you will need to deploy and host your own instance of the api as either a docker container or as a set of serverless functions behind an API gateway.

The documentation for deploying your very own instance of the compendium api can be found [here](https://freshwebio.github.io/compendium).
